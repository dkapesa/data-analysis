Executive Summary

The "E-Commerce Data Analysis" project leverages a rich dataset containing actual transactions from a UK-based online retailer. The data spans from December 2010 to December 2011 and includes critical variables such as invoice numbers, product descriptions, quantities, invoice dates, unit prices, customer IDs, and countries of origin. This dataset, maintained by the UCI Machine Learning Repository, offers a rare opportunity to explore detailed transactional data for a retailer specialising in unique, all-occasion gifts. The retailer serves a mix of retail and wholesale customers, with a significant focus on domestic markets.
The primary objective of this project is to extract actionable insights that inform and enhance the retailer’s operational and strategic decisions. By analysing customer behaviour, product performance, and sales trends, this project provides a comprehensive understanding of the factors driving revenue and growth. The findings are aimed at optimising pricing strategies, inventory management, and marketing campaigns while identifying opportunities for international expansion and customer retention.
Key areas of analysis include:
1.	Sales Trends: Identifying seasonal patterns and sales peaks over daily, weekly, and monthly periods.
2.	Customer Segmentation: Clustering customers based on purchasing behaviour to highlight the most profitable segments.
3.	Purchase Drivers: Analysing correlations between customer demographics, purchase frequency, and sales value.
4.	Product Performance: Determining the characteristics of bestselling products and understanding what drives their success.
5.	Customer Churn: Using classification models to predict churn and uncover factors influencing customer retention.
6.	Price-Sales Relationship: Investigating the correlation between product prices and sales volumes, including the impact of discounts and price variability.

The project is executed using Python and libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn, ensuring robust data processing, analysis, and visualisation. Key deliverables include detailed visualisations, statistical analyses, and data-driven recommendations that address the retailer’s most pressing challenges and opportunities. This project not only demonstrates technical proficiency but also showcases the ability to apply data-driven strategies to real-world business scenarios.
